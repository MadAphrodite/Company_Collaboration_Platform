# Company Collaboration Platform
The company decided to build an application, that will increase employee productivity and internal communication. They have more than 3000 employees distributed across different departments and offices.  
The goal of the project is to make testing documentation for the company's collaboration platform, which will be used to organize how employees talk to each other and work together. Test cases will be created for both the existing and new features, which will then be used for both functional and regression testing.

## The vision
The company decided to build an application that will allow employees to:
* Have visibility over the company structure with an up to date organization chart
* Build stronger connections with colleagues by having easy access to their interests, experience, skills and more
* Be more productive by enabling them to quickly browse through facility and meeting room availability and office locations
* Collaborate efficiently by creating custom contact lists for projects, events, social activities
* Create and update their user status, such as sick leave, vacation, maternity leave
